## Network Representations

For the exploratory data analysis, we used the TSV file [`list-2023-affix-colexifications-threshold-4`](graphs/list-2023-affix-colexifications-threshold-4.tsv), which we analyzed with the help of [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org). See [Tjuka (2024)](https://doi.org/10.15475/calcip.2024.1.2) for a detailed tutorial illustrating how data can be analyzed with Cytoscape.
